Lab 1

I would like to be evaluated via video.

To use this lab, run ```node server.js``` in the root diretory. From the homepage you can search for a product and create a product.
To retrieve a specific product, you can either enter the url into the browser localhost:3000/products/productID or click a link within the search.

To add a review, you can add one on a product's specific page. You can also view reviews there as well.

What resources do you have and what is their structure?
    The resources I have are products and have the structure 
    {
        name: string
        price: number
        dimensions: Obj
        stock: number
        reviews: Array
        id: number
    }
    The fields of these products ensure I can represent all the data to the client once requested.


b. Which HTTP methods are you using for various operations and why?
For retrieveing a list of products, individual products as well as product reviews, I used the GET method to retrieve data from the server.
For adding products and product reviews, I used the POST method to send data to the server.
c. What is your URI naming scheme?
My uri naming scheme is 
products/
products/:productID
products/:productID/reviews

d. What response codes are you sending and why?
I am sending status code 200 for a succesful request, status code 404 when the user requests something the server doesn't have, and 201 when a new resource is created.
